# golang-postgres-test

Postgres CRUD API created in Golang for learning purposes. I try to to this a little bit every day but not too much per one day, slowly but surely.

## devlog

24.04.2022 Studied flexbox more. Maybe I succeed to build a decent frontend with it.

23.04.2022: I tried to create layout with Svelte and flexbox. Again reminder that just by assuming how things work is bad practice.

22.04.2022: Added beginning of frontend. Need to study a bit svelte next.

21.04.2022: Added the first unit test

20.04.2022: Started the project
